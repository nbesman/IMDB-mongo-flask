# IMDB-mongo-flask

This project is all about getting large image files from TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/) with an API request. 
the files are inserted into mongoDB database. 
with python FLASK we are applying a web page that has a search line. 
the user can enter a movie name and get a movie poster presented on the screen. 

have fun and be good :)
